                 Dear Students, Parents, and Well Wishers!
                Itâ€™s my great pleasure to welcome you all in Central Campus of Technology (CCT). It is situated at a very beautiful height at north-east corner of Dharan city. It is surrounded by peaceful and natural environment, really a suitable place for study.

                </p>

                <p>
                    CCT as an academic institution was established in 2028 B.S. During this span of life, the institution has been able to achieve its set goals and most of the objectives in the field of academic activities. It has been involved in providing quality education in food technology, nutrition & dietetics, microbiology and physics at bachelor and masters level. Being a central campus of Food Technology, it is   the only institution that runs Ph. D. program in food technology. We proudly announce that CCT will strive to transform it into Deemed University of Food Science and Technology, making it one of finest research stations for post-harvest technology of the SAARC Region. Pass out students of this institution are employed at various places of Nepal as well as foreign countries, too. So, we are always proud of them. However, the country is still lacking in having necessary numbers of skilled and competent human resources in this field. Our mission is to fulfill this gap. We are committed to provide practical, value based and goal oriented education of the 21st century, which we design the best desired manpower in the present world.
Lastly, I am confident and optimistic that CCT will be a center of excellence in multi-discipline areas of science and technology
