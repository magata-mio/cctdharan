                    Dear Students, Parents, and Well Wishers!

                    Nepal is a country based on agro-economy. More than 67% of its population depends on agriculture. The geographical diversity of the nation provides favorable condition for diverse food products. The Tarai region is suitable for grain products like paddy, wheat and corn. Similarly, the hilly region is suitable for fruits and vegetables, along with the grain products. Likewise, the topography of the Himalayan region suits for the herbal medicinal plants. But, due to the lack of technically skilled man power, Nepal is yet unable to provide food security to its citizens. Thus, to explore and make the maximum utilization of its diverse food products by producing qualified and technically equipped human resource CCT was established in 2028 B.S.
