                    The aim of today's education is to foster all-round development with a special focus to incorporate three major genres of education: (i) reasoning, (ii) psychomotor, and (iii) emotional learning. This is where terms like extracurricular- and co-curricular activities come in. Extracurricular activities are not explicitly tied to the curriculum but have important role in all round development of the student. Generally speaking, co-curricular activities are an extension of the formal learning experiences in a course or academic program. Co-curricular activities usually complement the regular curriculum. In T. U. constituent campuses, these activities are administered by Student Welfare Chief (one of the faculties appointed by the Campus Chief). In the process of applying for QAA certiﬁcation, CCT has formed a parallel Co-Curricular Activity Committee which also does the work of Student Welfare Committee. Free Students' Union (FSU) and other student organizations are important stakeholders in diﬀerent co-curricular and extracurricular activities.
