                    National Planning Commission (Nepal) clearly spelled in its Tenth Plan (2002-2007) the adoption of the principle of cost recovery in higher education to reduce the share of the government and implement the system of block grant instead of existing grant system based on the number of teachers. CCT adopted this plan and became an autonomous campus in 2012.

                    The principal sources of finance for CCT are the UGC block grant and student fee from regular (Tribhuvan University owned) and self-supporting academic programs.

                    Other minor sources of income are the analytical services and training programs that the campus provides against payment. In case of capital expenditures that call for heavy funding (e.g., infrastructure strengthening and adding new demand-driven academic programs) the campus normally requests the Government (or other donor agencies) for special budget (provision).

                    However, there are several other ways to reduce the campus operation cost. For example, the campus does not have to pay for water because it now has its own source. It has 26.5 KVA solar energy for cutting electricity bill. It is going to operate its pilot plants in semi-commercial scale (bottled water, dairy items, bakery items, and traditional foods). Lastly, it has planted tea, coffee, lemon, orange and many other high-value plants, which hopefully will enter the market as value-added or specialty products in a couple of years.
