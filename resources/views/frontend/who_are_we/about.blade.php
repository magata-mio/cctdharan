        <h5>Our Vision</h5>
        <p>
            Central Campus of Technology, Dharan is the fore runner of food technology education in Nepal. To date, the campus has produced more than 500 highly qualified food technology graduates. Annually, nearly 25 percent of them go abroad for further studies. Ten percent of them find Government jobs and the rest go like hot cakes in various food industries on Nepal and abroad. The scope of food technology education in Nepal has increased dramatically in the past few years. As a result, by 2014, there are 11 academic institutions where food technology education is offered. In the light of recent trend in food technology education in Nepal.

        <p>To further broaden its scope Central Campus of Technology has prepared a new vision statement:</p>

        <p>
            <q class="lead">Central Campus of Technology will strive to transition into Deemed University of Food Science and Technology, making it one of the finest research stations for post-harvest technology of the SAARC Region.</q>

        <h5>Our Mission</h5>
        <p>
            It is beyond dispute that there is nothing as indispensable as food for all life forms on earth. In the recent time, however, food crisis has risen to the state of emergency in many developing countries. Food insecurity is pervasive throughout much of Nepal.
        </p>

        <p>Whenever food crisis occurs in Nepal, we have to depend on donors for the food supply. This situation is quite humiliating for a resource-rich country like ours. Besides, emergency food supplies by donor agencies and even plain import can never be a permanent solution. It will only enslave our economy. The reasons behind food insecurity in Nepal and the available options for combating it hardly need elaboration. Food insecurity may result from failed harvest, poor distribution, post-harvest loos, poor access (physical and nutrition), and so on. National Planners are preoccupied with increasing productivity (pre-harvest). Scientists are working day in and day out for developing improved crop varieties, increasing productivity, and devising better farming systems, with the hope to combat food insecurity. Even 2-3% increase in yield is hailed as a success.But what they fail to understand is, because of the lack of proper post-harvest knowledge, nearly 50% of fruits and vegetables and about 20% of cereal grains painstakingly researched and produced are being lost. This is where food technology comes in and combats food insecurity. Control of post-harvest loss, be it by a few percent, can be worth food security for millions of people.</p>

        <p>Thus, the mission of Central Campus of Technology is:</p>

        <p>
            <q class="lead">To strengthen research facilities and develop post-harvest technology & allied programs to the point where Central Campus of Technology can be a deemed university in its own right. </q>

        <h5>Brief History of CCT</h5>
        <p>
            After the implementation of national education in Nepal in 1971 (2028 B. S.), all the higher education centers scattered all over the country were unified under the umbrella of Tribhuvan University. Subsequently, Institute of Applied Science and Technology (IASTEC), which became the forerunner of Food Technology program in Nepal, was established in 1972 in Dharan. This was the turning point in the history of Food Technology education in Nepal.
