               <h1>Pedagogy</h1>
               <p>
                Pedagogy is the profession, science or theory of teaching. As such, university education does not require pedagogical qualification/competence on the part of the educator: disciplinary competency is the sole criteria for the eligibility. However, higher education institutions have a training mission and therefore require pedagogical competencies in addition to mastery in discipline.

                CCT is the choice of students aspiring to study Food Technology in Nepal. It is the only option in Nepal for studying B. Sc. in Nutrition and Dietetics. It is also one of the few campuses that offer B. Sc. in Geology. We assume that the reason for preferring this campus is the good pedagogy and the robust Education Management Information System (EMIS) which CCT has always strived to maintain.

                In the recent years, CCT has made significant progress in resource adaptation and pedagogy. It has emphasized ICT-based education and, to this end, every classroom now has projectors and CCTVs installed. Student attendance and class log record and are now maintained through a user-friendly customized app called "CCT Teacher".

                CCT emphasizes learner-centered, research-oriented pedagogy to inculcate a life-long learning culture in students. Faculty development program has been considered a stand-alone educational pedagogy in enriching the faculty vitality: fostering knowledge, skills, and professional competence of faculty. This is why CCT regularly facilitates faculty participation in training programs, provides in-house research grants, and encourages advanced studies (Ph.D.). The main basis of teaching at CCT is the conventional lecture method but the faculties are at liberty to use their innovative/ingenious techniques to make the learning process more effective and engrossing. The campus is contemplating using Moodle (Modular Object-Oriented Dynamic Learning Environment) in the near future.
